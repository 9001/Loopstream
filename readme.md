# Loopstream
internet radio streaming rig

## Maintainers:
`tools.dfc` contains utilities used by Loopstream at runtime, including stuff like `lame.exe` which *probably* shouldn't be in the source repo. So when making commits or pull requests, make sure to leave `tools.dfc` unmodified unless you need to modify the other resource files (web wizard or sfx).
