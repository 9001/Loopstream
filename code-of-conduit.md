# Code of Conduit
* write code that works
* nobody cares about shit like method names or the phrasing of comments
* only discuss stuff that affects how the program operates at runtime

### strict zero tolerance for complaining about the lack of pronouns invented after 1990
* you have the freedom to use them for yourself
* but respect that other people simply don't care
